> Also been called as H version.

This is a modified version of Alice In Cradle. Mainly modified many behavior logics of the Noel, monster logic and map logic, etc. These content changes are primarily focused on making it easier for players to play R18 contents, and I will attempt to remove R18-Gore contents in subsequent updates (if there is no such configuration in the main game.)

Due to specialty of the project, please read `changelogs.txt` in each released zip.

This mod works on only Windows.

#### Q/A

* Are the files safe?

  Each time a release build is uploaded, a VirusTotal scan report is attached.
  You can submit files to [VirusTotal - Home](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) to upload and scan

* Can you elaborate on what has been changed?

   Please check the changelogs.txt in each release package

* Will these changes break the game balance

   **Yes**. such as dangerous level modification

* Can I suggest something to add?

   Please submit issues, but may not be replied

* I am the original author and I wish to remove this unlicensed distribution.

   Please contact me, or request a DMCA takedown

* Can you make a BepInEx version?

   At present, the original game is temporarily unstable, and this project involves a lot of complex logic modifications. Using BepInEx requires IL and bytecode escapes, which is very troublesome. So I won't write a BepInEx version until the original is stable.
